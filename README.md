#This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected

The run_ analysis.R script is used to perform a cleaning operation on a set of data obtained from the website - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
In summmary the scripts does the following:

# Step 1
 Merges the training and test sets to create one data set


# Step 2
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement


# Step 3
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


# Step 4
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names


# Step 5
Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
