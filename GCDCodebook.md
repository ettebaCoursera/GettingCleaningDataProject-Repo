## Project Description
This project involves getting two sets of data from the website(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), cleaning the data sets, merging them and implementing statistical operations on the merged data set to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the extracted data.

##Project design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The raw data was obtained from (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.


##Creating the tidy data

###Guide to create the tidy data file
1. The zip file for the data was downloaded unto my working directory on my computer.
2. The downloaded data was 
3.

###Cleaning the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

##Description of variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 The tidyData has a dimension of 180 rows and 21 columns.
 
The data has the following column names or variables:
"activityID"                      "subjectID"                       "timeBodyAccMagnitudeMean"       
"timeBodyAccMagnitudeStdDev"      "timeGravityAccMagnitudeMean"     "timeGravityAccMagnitudeStdDev"  
"timeBodyAccJerkMagnitudeMean"    "timeBodyAccJerkMagnitudeStdDev"  "timeBodyGyroMagnitudeMean"      
"timeBodyGyroMagnitudeStdDev"     "timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeMean"   "timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeStdDev"
"freqBodyAccMagnitudeMean"        "freqBodyAccMagnitudeStdDev"      "freqBodyAccJerkMagnitudeMean"   
"freqBodyAccJerkMagnitudeStdDev"  "freqBodyGyroMagnitudeMean"       "freqBodyGyroMagnitudeStdDev"    
"freqBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeMean"   "freqBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeStdDev" "activityType"
 



###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.
"activityID" - 
"subjectID"  -
"timeBodyAccMagnitudeMean" - 
"timeBodyAccMagnitudeStdDev" -
"timeGravityAccMagnitudeMean" -
"timeGravityAccMagnitudeStdDev" - 

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
